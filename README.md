This small project is for the calculation of the grid intensity, energy mix, and emission factors based on the EMBER yearly electricity data.
EMBER provides granular information about electricity demand, capacity, generation, and also emissions. Based on the publicly available dataset, it is therefore possible to calculate:
-energy mix
-grid intensity, and
-emission factors
at global and also region or country levels. 

These calculations might be useful for the calculations of electricity-related points in other sectors as well (such as Scope 2 in e.g., Steel industry). Nonetheless, it is not enough to have electricity intensity or emission figures for industries as Scope 2 involves 'purchased' electricity which imposes another variable.
